= Hacking

This is mostly a collection of notes to self, on ideas of where to look at
interesting stuff. Eventually I will add, if needed, the typical notes on code
style, project structure, etc.

  of 2DA files where to find for tables to plot]

  to damage and hit according to Strength] and the complementary for
  https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/files/2da/2da_bgee/strmodex.htm[extraordinary
  Strength]

== Table/chart ideas

- Number of spells (and at which levels) per XP. As in, to see how many spells
  per day a Bard can cast, and at which level. Would be interesting to see the
  character level as well, to see the efficiency of spells like Remove Magic.
  Also remember to consider multi-classes, to see the number of spells per day
  of e.g. a Bard vs a Fighter/Mage.

- Number of HP per XP. As in Imoen at 20K XP is level 6, and with the bonus on
  Constitution, she has 48 HP, while a Cleric would be level 8, so without bonus
  from Constitution would have less HP.

- THAC0 per XP. Would be interesting to see the THAC0 of a Fighter/Mage vs Bard.

- Backstab multiplier per XP. There is a post on Beamdog Forums that compares
  somewhat the damage done with an Assassin and with a Fighter/Thief. They seem
  to be roughly on par, even though at levels where the Assassin is not reaching
  multiplier beyond 5. Also would be interesting to compare against Stalker.


== Historical notes from EEKeeper

 As a heads up to any other developers interested in assisting @Troodon80 with
 the project, I'm stepping in and attempting to port the current code (and any
 additions made in the meantime) over to Qt to make it cross-platform capable.
 I've gotten a substantial amount of the GUI ported over, and I'm just getting
 ready to port over the actual "nuts and bolts" code, so hopefully I have
 something somewhat working soon.

Some since things about porting to Qt:

1. Unicode is handled by default, so non-Ascii, especially Asian, languages
should be handled 2. Translations for the GUI are extremely simple, so community
members can help translate the actual interface for non-English speakers 3. Qt
works with Windows, Mac, and Linux (if Beamdog are able to release on that
platform)

I wouldn't expect a full-conversion for a while, but I just finished mid-terms
and the girlfriend is out of town for the weekend, so I should be able to make
some decent headway in the coming week :D

As soon as it's in at least an Alpha-worthy state, I'll see about creating a
fork on the EE:Keeper sourceforge page and repository for now while testing, etc
is done to ensure full compatibility. All that will be worked out with
@Troodon80, of course. Another consideration is updating the license present in
all the source code, etc, to determine what the best way is of ensuring
up-to-date credit is maintained, which is a pretty substantial portion of OS
licensing, etc. But, again, that can be worked out.

 For anyone interested in the Qt stuff, it's currently under a branch called qt
 on the Sourceforge repository, if it's generally accessible now. Hopefully it
 finishes up relatively quickly now that it's out there.

Not the sexiest code by any means, but it's getting there!

 @Parasprite I've been looking at some of the structures from the original
 Shadow Keeper during conversion, and there a quite a few places that were
 "unknown" during original creation that are now documented at IEDSP. One of
 those is the name, where an "unknown" section after the name in the structure
 for PCs is actually the rest of the 32-byte max length.

What happens is the game, and EE Keeper, looks at the game table and reads
"PALADIN". That's the class. For example: When the table reads "FIGHTER_MAGE",
it means there can be a potential dual class or multiclass because there is more
than one class available; either of the two classes can be set as the 'original'
class. That's not actually how it works, but it's the easiest and least
confusing way I can explain it.

@oskargargas, it is open source. However, due to not having the time to
actually update the source code online I suppose you could consider it closed
source. There are a number of things I want to do before updating the soruce,
though. It is currently quite messy with compiler flags, etc., and I want to
trim it down and clean it up before releasing it.

@oskargargas, or the compiler flags I use on a daily basis as part of my work.
EE Keeper is only a small program, but I would still like to clean some of it
up. There's some redundant functions there that I rewrote and didn't get rid of
at the time (compiler flags to disable). I have no idea when I'll get a chance
to do update the source, but it probably won't be before the new year.

@crimsonknight, no, sorry. Even if I completely rewrote the code to be
compatible with Android, I would probably have to remove myself from the game
developers' official forum (due to being a moderator). Google/Android's terms of
use are quite draconian with regards to one application editing the files from
another, and if it appears that Beamdog are condoning the use of this
application in conjunction with their game then the game itself might end up
dropped from the store.

This is a large, important post with screenshots, and several explanations.


https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/comment/508682/#Comment_508682[About the
detection of games]

[quote]
The old versions of Keeper, like Shadow Keeper, tried to detect the game via
executable. This was to try and prevent the user opening a BG1 saved game in
Keeper when only BG2 saved games were expected. In retrospect, this could have
been handled by including the structures for both games and making an all-in-one
editor. However, since both Enhanced Editions use the same executable name, that
is now pointless. If you happen to be using a very early version of Keeper, then
you will need to update to avoid issues.

As for the code, you should only need to log in to SourceForge in order to view.
Note that it's the Qt code and not the MFC code; i.e. the one that I am
dedicated to here on the forumâ€”I am chipping away at the Qt version in my spare
time, but since it is basically from the ground up, it gets less attention than
the one that is tried and tested (whether it works or not is a different thing
:D). I have done more on the Qt version but haven't bothered updating the
repository since mattinm apparently left (probably too busy).

A lengthy post from Troodon80 with thought on how to setup "profiles" for
different games, including EE vs classic, continued by himself and with some
answers a bit below, in the same page.
